\section{Definition of Several Maneuvers}
As is mentioned in the report, we decided to have total 81 time steps in our generated scenarios, which will result in a total timespan of 3.24 seconds. Since the recordings have 25 frames per second, the $\Delta time$ between each time step is 0.04 seconds.
\subsection{Lane Change}
\textit{Lane Change} occurs when the ego vehicle changes its lane, comparing two adjacent timesteps.
\subsection{Cut-in}
If there is a \textit{Lane Change} and the ego vehicle runs in front of a surrounding vehicle which was preceding the ego vehicle before, it is defined as \textit{Cut-in}.
\subsection{Brake}
Compared the acceleration at two adjacent timesteps, if the vehicle decelerates, it is considered as braking during this $\Delta time$.

\section{Description of Each Feature}
\begin{enumerate}
\item ego-v-init: the absolute velocity at the beginning.
\item ego-acc-init: the acceleration at the beginning.
\item l-rel-pos-init: the relative distance between the rear vehicle and the ego vehicle at the beginning. If there is no rear vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item p-rel-pos-init: the relative distance between the preceding vehicle and the ego vehicle at the beginning. If there is no preceding vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item ll-rel-pos-init: the relative distance between the left-rear vehicle and the ego vehicle at the beginning. If there is no left-rear vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item pl-rel-pos-init: the relative distance between the left-preceding vehicle and the ego vehicle at the beginning. If there is no left-preceding vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item lr-rel-pos-init: the relative distance between the right-rear vehicle and the ego vehicle at the beginning. If there is no right-rear vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item pr-rel-pos-init: the relative distance between the right-preceding vehicle and the ego vehicle at the beginning. If there is no right-preceding vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item surr-veh-count-init: counting the number of surrounding vehicles at the beginning. If there is no surrounding vehicle at that time, return 0.
\item ego-acc-min: the minimal acceleration of the ego vehicle during the whole timespan.
\item ego-braketime-max: the total duration of brake. 
\item ego-v-end: the absolute velocity at the end.
\item l-rel-pos-end: the relative distance between the rear vehicle and the ego vehicle at the end. If there is no rear vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item p-rel-pos-end: the relative distance between the preceding vehicle and the ego vehicle at the end. If there is no preceding vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item ll-rel-pos-end: the relative distance between the left-rear vehicle and the ego vehicle at the end. If there is no left-rear vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item pl-rel-pos-end: the relative distance between the left-preceding vehicle and the ego vehicle at the end. If there is no left-preceding vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item lr-rel-pos-end: the relative distance between the right-rear vehicle and the ego vehicle at the end. If there is no right-rear vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item pr-rel-pos-end: the relative distance between the right-preceding vehicle and the ego vehicle at the end. If there is no right-preceding vehicle at that time, return -1.
\item surr-veh-count-end: counting the number of surrounding vehicles at the end. If there is no surrounding vehicle at that time, return 0.
\item ego-lane-change-ts: when the \textit{lane change}maneuver of ego vehicle occurs. If there is no \textit{lane change}, return -1.
\item ego-lane-change: whether the \textit{lane change} maneuver of ego vehicle occurs. The value of 0/+1/-1 means the EGO has no lane change, turns right and turns left respectively.
\item cut-in-ts: when the \textit{cut-in}maneuver of ego vehicle occurs. If there is no \textit{cut-in}, return -1.
\item cut-in-dir: whether the \textit{cut-in} maneuver of ego vehicle occurs. The value of 0/+1/-1 means the EGO has no cut-in, cuts in to left side and cuts in to right side respectively.
\item cut-in-dist-reduced: if \textit{cut-in} occurs, how many relative distance between the EGO (cutting-in vehicle) and targeted vehicle (the vehicle being cut-in) is reduced. If no \textit{cut-in} occurs, return -1.
\item min-dhw: the minimal DHW of the scenario.
\item ego-v-min-dhw: the absolute velocity at the minimal DHW.
\item ego-acc-min-dhw: the acceleration at the minimal DHW.
\item l-rel-pos-min-dhw: the relative distance between the rear vehicle and the ego vehicle at the minimal DHW. If there is no rear vehicle at that time, return -1.
